# SeQura challenge resolution
This respository contains the resolution to the SeQura challenge created for the Senior Data Engineer position.
It has an unconventional structure because its meant to contain topics that I'd personally store in diferent repositories, if this was meant to be production ready (like infrastructure and pipeline code).
